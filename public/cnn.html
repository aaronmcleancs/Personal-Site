        <section id="methodology" class="showcase__section">
            <h2>Methodology & Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                Our approach borrows key principles from AlexNet, a landmark CNN introduced by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), adapting them to fit the specific challenges of classifying COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia-affected chest X-rays. By incorporating ReLU activation functions, LRN, overlapping pooling, and dropout, we ensure the model can extract intricate patterns from medical images, improve its generalization capabilities, and mitigate overfitting.
            </p>

            <h4>ReLU Activation Function</h4>
            <p>
                Instead of traditional sigmoid or tanh units, we deploy ReLU activations:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                f(x) = \max(0, x)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                ReLU accelerates training by preventing vanishing gradients and promoting sparse activations. This increased efficiency is critical for a large-scale model (~15 million parameters) and ensures that our training cycles are more productive, converging faster to high accuracy.
            </p>

            <h4>Local Response Normalization (LRN)</h4>
            <p>
                To enhance feature selectivity, our model implements LRN, encouraging local competition among neurons and emphasizing discriminative patterns:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                b_{i,x,y} = \frac{a_{i,x,y}}{\left(k + \alpha \sum_{j=\max(0,i-\frac{n}{2})}^{\min(N-1,i+\frac{n}{2})} (a_{j,x,y})^2 \right)^{\beta}}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                LRN helps reduce redundancy in learned features and fosters robust representations, which is especially valuable when distinguishing subtle differences in chest radiographs.
            </p>

            <h4>Overlapping Pooling</h4>
            <p>
                By using overlapping pooling regions (\( s < z \)), the model captures a more fine-grained spatial representation of features:
            </p>
            <p>
                This subtle architectural choice helps reduce classification error rates and strengthens generalization, making it easier for the model to identify nuanced pathological markers in lung fields.
            </p>

            <h4>Dropout Regularization</h4>
            <p>
                To counter overfitting, dropout (0.5 rate) is applied in the fully connected layers:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                P(h_j \mid x) = \sum_i P(h_j \mid i) P(i \mid x)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                Randomly “dropping” neurons during training introduces a form of ensemble averaging, improving the model’s ability to generalize beyond its training distribution.
            </p>

            <h4>Data Augmentation</h4>
            <p>
                We employ data augmentation strategies—including random cropping, horizontal flipping, and PCA-based RGB intensity adjustments—to make the model more invariant to photometric and geometric transformations. These enhanced variations help the model adapt to real-world scenarios, where X-ray images may differ in orientation, brightness, or noise.
            </p>

            <h4>Architecture Details</h4>
            <p>
                Our CNN is structured similarly to AlexNet: five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. This hierarchical design extracts progressively complex features—from simple edges and textures to medically relevant patterns. The final softmax layer outputs class probabilities for the target categories.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/alexnet.png" alt="AlexNet Diagram" style="max-width: 1300px; width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

            <h4>Optimization and Training</h4>
            <p>
                Training employs the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of \(\eta = 1 \times 10^{-3}\) on a dataset of \( n = 9962 \) labeled X-ray images. Adam’s adaptive learning rates and momentum considerations streamline convergence. We use early stopping based on validation loss and integrate TensorBoard callbacks for in-depth monitoring, ensuring that the model converges effectively without unnecessary complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The loss function is categorical crossentropy:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                \text{Loss} = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                This probabilistic measure suits multi-class classification tasks and aligns with the model’s goal of accurately discerning multiple respiratory conditions.
            </p>
